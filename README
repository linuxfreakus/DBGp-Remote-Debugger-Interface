forked from https://github.com/vim-scripts/DBGp-Remote-Debugger-Interface

The only thing I changed is the way that it finds/loads the python debugger module.
Now it works with vundle and all I need to do is point it at this repo. If the
upstream changes and I'm paying attention I'll merge the changes.

please if you find any bug, made a patch, diffs, etc, let me know...
